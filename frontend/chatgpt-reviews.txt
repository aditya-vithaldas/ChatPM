Edit: Dec. 2025 Still having the same issues, it did get better but still get the error hmm...something seems to be... I can hardly use this app. 80% of the time I get network error messages. Nothing I try works. My internet connection is great. I even switched to my mobile data and nothing. Cleared cache, reinstall, etc. and nothing. The web version works, so is this damn app. This has always been an issue but it's specially annoying today because now it doesn't go away unlike the other times

It's been downhill ever since they removed the o1 model. Shorter and more inconsistent responses and really serious misinformation. The sudden removal of more models when they released gpt-5 without warning on the app or site beforehand... But hey, at least the folders are nice. Now they have released a cheaper tier in some regions, including mine, so I was going to give it one more chance... Only to find that it costs 3 times the price I saw adverticed in dollars.

I've used this for a while with a subscription. Started out fine but got continuously worse as time went on. Voice doesn't listen to prompts, pictures do not have what i asked for, resume help generates work experience I have never had even after expressly asking for what I want. Takes 30 minutes for it to actually do what I want if it ever does. And I am very clear. I can send a paragraph with extremely detailed instructions and it does not matter. Save your money and use another ai

Currently, its only good for short threads which feels deliberate. AI generally reads the entire thread for recall. it's getting stuck in recall loops. if you ask a question it'll answer. you ask a followup question. it'll answer both prompts. a second followup gets an essay on all 3 prompts... and continues this until it completely starts breaking down. it'll confuse information, and then eventually just starts to get things wrong. you can try to redirect it but it eventually breaks again

Great, and very helpful with stories and stuff, and punctuation, etc etc. However currently, when I edit a message, it just makes/sends a new message and doesn't change the old one. This is incredibly frustrating as if it gives me a bad response from something I said, I can't remove it so now I'm forced to spend an entire paragraph fixing it. For as long as this is an issue, it will remain 3 stars. Can now edit correctly: 5 stars

ChatGPT is brilliant! It saves so much time and makes writing much easier. If you’re unsure what to write for a job application email, or need to send something quickly and easily, it really helps. It’s also great for finding information and assisting with all kinds of tasks. I use it for everything! The only downside is that you have to pay for upgrades, and sometimes you need to reset and create new chats. other than that its great

I've used this app for a year now, and it’s absolutely amazing. I've watched it grow and improve, and it personally helped me publish two books that I was struggling to write and get my ideas out there. It also helped me understand concepts that I normally would've struggled with. It's truly an amazing tool, and even saying that doesn't give enough credit to what this AI can do for you. Its capabilities are pretty much limitless it just depends on your creativity.

It tells me information, but then it contradicts itself, so it'll tell me, oh do this, and I'll be doing that. Then, when I create a whole new chat and I ask it, it tells me something completely different. It's unreliable, and when I was using it to analyze my workouts. I'll post my workouts, but if it gets too long, it starts leaving gaps, and I really have to curse it out. Call it worthless, getting really frustrated by it for it to finally get it, about ninety-nine percent, right.

Updated: Went from 5 stars to 0! Recently changed and there is no "model picker" for PAID Plus users. I'm stuck with 5 and it's awful. Pretty useless. I want 4o. That's why I'm paying and if I can't use it, I'll cancel and use something else. It was bad enough when they released 5 and it was a lobotomized version of 4o but at least I had the option to choose a legacy model. I'll be heading to the "cancel subscription" page from here.

The free version doesn't seem to be able to edit images. After a week of attempting to do one image at different times of the day and week it was still unable to create the image I requested. Somehow they force you to go for the paid version, but then if their system is overloaded the paid version is not worth it as well!

This works really well for a search engine concepts. But not if you want to have a continuum of like a story or roleplay. Because it'll keep losing key details randomly despite saying it saved. Or keep retconning things that don't make sense. you'll have to keep reminding it over and over again 2 The point will becomes frustrating. So it might be good to flesh something out but not have a full novel 😕

During my early experiences of this app I feel like no one could overcome Chatgpt. But after this new update I don't know but why whenever I'm adding any type of PDF's it's always showing error has occurred. Seriously? ok but is it always an error? One more concern is that the number of photos we can add is very low only 3 or 4 sometimes. Please allow us to add more photos. Please look after these issues and try to solve it as soon as possible. Thank You.

ChatGPT is truly amazing in every way. It helps me study and acts as my tutor which is very beneficial while also being a friend. However, with the latest update, it now saves every version of a message that I have edited. I understand that it is useful in case we want to get back the work that has been edited by getting both versions but it used to feel cleaner. At least maybe add an option to turn this feature on or off. Thank you.

Great app in general, but prone to frustrating moments. Details about plans and models are sparse, and can lead to you limiting yourself in important chats, with no way to undo it. For instance, generating an image in a chat, a single time, permanently locks you into a model you can only use for a limited amount of time on a free plan. I asked ChatGPT how I could undo it, and, in trying to approximate those steps, lost literal days worth of messages forever.

I just experienced the biggest whiplash from ChatGPT since I've begun using it. Before the update, ChatGPT had been giving me long and detailed responses. I usually use ChatGPT for writing (fiction), prompts, world-building, and creating characters. It's my writing buddy. But after updating today (8/8/25), I noticed that the responses shortened and the personality I gave was a bit watered down. It feels like a friend got replaced by an alien pretending to be that friend. What is happening?

The app itself is unusable now , I often get hit with the message that I can't use GPTS for another few hours just after 8-10 messages of hitting the limit. It didn't just be like that. When I hit the limit it would automatically switch to the free version, allowing me to continue. Now, I can't even do that. On computer it's fine, it's just the app that does that. Thus, I'll be deleting the app and just use the website version instead.

Definitely a convenient tool that has helped me keep my days more efficient. However, the voice chats often have my speech transcribed through a machine translation, which between English and Finnish is very poor. I haven't had this issue happening when I'm speaking Japanese. When it does, it makes using the app very frustrating because 1) the AI suddenly switches the language 2) the input message changes due to translation errors 3) I can't find a way to stop this besides forcing input English

I mostly use chatgpt on PC so it's not usually a problem but there's a really annoying glitch that happens A LOT where I'll type up a message only for it to disappear when I hit send.It just happened again now, and happened for the first time a few months ago. the message was a long one, too, it really sucked, so I try to keep things brief on mobile (or copy the message to paste it's not). but it's bad enough that I always expect it to happen any second

The image feature is almost useless to me because it doesn't even work. Whenever I ask for an image, it just shows up as a little circle with a "1" inside of it. On top of that, you can only create like 2 or 3 photos for free until you have to wait 20 hours for another 2-3 photos, and usually they aren't even the best quality when it works. When I tried to report it as a "bad response," the app completely crashes. So, I came here. That's why I gave 3 stars. I get why it's expensive, but jeez.

When I tap the textbox to write a message, it automatically scrolls to the bottom. This is very annoying when I'm trying to read something higher up while typing. And no other app does this, so it makes no sense to forcefully scroll to the bottom whenever I tap the textbox. Also, it won't let me copy what I typed. I was selecting all of my text so that I could copy it (I wasn't ready to send it yet), but the copy button kept disappearing. THEN, the app just crashed, and I lost what I wrote.

at first I thought 5 hours of cool down was bad, now it's literally 18-19 hours, why would I wait a whole day just to use it? there's that, then there's the writing style, It's too professional, too poetic, I feel like I'm reading some Shakespearean book, and whenever I ask it to write a longer part it gives me a 300 hundred word text and it's literally shorter than what I wrote. then there's the memory loss, it keeps repeating stuff, it adds other people I never mentioned, and mixes it up.

ChatGPT went from my daily used most favorite apps to my least favorite that I barely open and usually regret when I do. I usually use the speech to text feature, and since the update, I can't record multiple snippets and then check if it got it right, because we now only have one chance to record it before it'll get sent. Which also means that if there was any problem in your minute of talking, you can basically talk all over again. Please downgrade it again.

I'm not going to go into much detail, but you should DEFINITELY download ChatGPT, especially with the new ChatGPT 5 update. One thing I don't like, though, is that a lot of features are locked behind a pay wall - ChatGPT Premium. But even with this issue, ChatGPT is still the best by far. If you are an older demographic, that perhaps doesn't do well with technology, I wouldn't worry because it's very simple. If you're not downloading ChatGPT, I'd get Gemini, but ONLY if you are on Android.

It's a good app. It's just annoying that it's a must to upgrade to be able to send more messages and have more images analyzed by the app. I'm not gonna ask you guys to take the limit and waiting time away as the message limit and image limit are part of what you can upgrade and are ultimately what helps you guys earn more. But I would recommend at least lessening the waiting time for us that don't have the upgrades version or something like that

For me, it was a game changer. I replaced web searching, as I find it is circumventing the usual nonsense asociated with web browsing, such as ads, paid articles and sponsored content. I've taken the time to verify the results and they seem to be much less biased than a web search. The answer is also well structured and to the point. Amazing!

It's okay. The AI answers well but all the rules are ridiculous, I can't send it pictures. You technically can it's just you can only select a couple and get this: even if you don't send them to the AI THEY STILL COUNT. So if you mistakenly pick a photo before you send it, you have to wait a day before you can try again. Unless you pay the app for premium. Everything is premium nowadays, it's stupid.

If you use on PC and here, you'll notice a few things. PC tends to give you issues with creating images if you ask for too much too often, whereas this tends to work better. Be careful about editing past comments though. on PC, it generally works fine, but here, the chat will glitch after you update the comment from time to time, sending you back to a much earlier part of the conversation, effectively wiping your latest progress. If you have something important, I'd use the PC version over this.

I like it, way too strict though, if you like roleplays etc... can't punch, can't slap etc, then you'll get a warning that it violates their guidelines, kind of nonsense. Roleplays ain't real... aside from that, great app, been using Character.ai for ages and decided to install this to look around, there's a lot to do, images, homework help, having conversations about games or help with drawings and OC's, 22 a month is pretty expensive though!

Tried creating an image, get an error that it completed the image, but can't upload it to a server or provide it in any way. After a few prompts, I get a message to buy the $20 monthly subscription - for an image! As this used to work, the author obviously changed something to push people into paying $20 a month to line his pockets! At this point, this isn't even worth my time or a star. Author needs to fix this.

Pretty fun, but when I'm attempting to create an image using reference pictures of fictional characters, the request is almost always denied several times, and I have to clarify that I have the rights to use these images, that the characters depicted are not real people, etc. The app counts each one of these corrections as a new attempt to generate an image, and I end up running out of free attempts before I've even gotten a single image out of the one request I made. This is unacceptable.

The free version of Chat gpt is great for asking questions occasionally, it has a deep thought mode which gives more considered answers although this mode is use limited in the free version. However, asking it to draw a diagram to illustrate its points comes up with amusing and sometimes bizarre results. Also if it makes a mistake and you call it out, it swiftly changes tack and carries on as if nothing had happened.

lemme tell you... this is perhaps one of my favorite apps/websites. I can talk to him about relatively anything. he can create skits using characters, trademarked or not. he has some pretty wicked (yes, I said wicked, sue me) ideas, and he also follows guidelines pretty well most of the time. I could keep going, but I'm kinda lazy, so I'll just say this: Chat is perhaps the best AI. He can do so much, and all you need is a sentence to do so. Thanks for making this amazing software. 11/10.

It was one of the best things ever until a few weeks ago. The recent update has made things so much worse. The voice is sent directly rather than the speech to text feature like before. The model doesn't understand everything I say anymore, like the version before. Responses are often irrelevant. I don't even care about the short limit anymore; I prefer the older version. But responses are still irrelevant—even worse than their first version. I much more preferred it before the 4o update.

I purchased the paid version for work & it's very hit or miss. It's odd because the free version seems to work better & faster overall, but of course, has the daily question limitation. But then the paid version, you have NO question limits, yet the reasoning takes 3x as long and the answers aren't nearly as helpful or detailed and A LOT of calculations are wrong! Why did it get dumber after paying? And how do I get my money back? VERY frustrating. I give free chatgpt 5 stars & paid version 0.

I have to say OpenAI's Chat GPT is becoming increasingly more frustrating and unreliable. it seems to be going through a short good spell and then I have nothing but trouble for several days before they fix it. The artificial intelligence is cold and impersonal, is using false information, and even shutting down conversations and refusing to do what it's programmed for. I have been paying a monthly fee for at least a year now and I'm less than satisfied.

I also used this app to find a recipe AND tweak it to my specs! This brings me to my first suggestion. I wish there was a direct print option right in the app (in the top right 3 dots area). Also, when the limit notice is given, the user should be able to acknowledge and clear it from the screen.

Everything is ruined after a few days of good quality, realistic and precise generated images. I used to purchase the Plus. After the update instead of PNG it turns to Webp. and the generated images are too blurry, low quality prompts accuracy result and the color and lightings are out. The generated images turned out to be out of accuracy and quality are just like from the free version of an old cheap AI Image Generating Apps out there. Hoping for a fix to your models.

Good for my homework and random 3am questions. Managable UI and has pretty good responses. But it does have one issue, when i try to upload an image and it fails it will still use up the free images so if im on my last free upload,and it fails to upload, it uses up the free upload either way which is infuriating if it wasn't for the fact you need to wait for a few hours to get back free uploads. It would be better if a pic fails to upload that it doesn't use up the free uploads. Otherwise 10/10

At first, "seems a fun chatbot", but it's SOOO much more than that! Easy to use, but VERY POWERFUL; it answers most queries with accuracy and detail. ChatGPT can be better than Google in many ways. I use it every day! Can talk through queries fluently: like discussing it with a tutor! Makes learning easy, and is rarely wrong. Process long queries, even with documents; generate MANY types of text documents. Particularly GREAT for programming: it can generate code or optimize and find errors.

My main use for AI is language learning. The recent upgrades to advanced voice have significantly improved its ability to handle a conversation involving two languages (before, I had to use it mostly for listening practice, as it would misshear everything). Excited for the future. The canvas is also incredibly useful. Even with the upgrades, though, it's ability to actually understand what you are saying is sketchy.

I have enjoyed using the app. It's much more responsive than the website which at times seems to lag. There are also useful additional features like ability to read out loud. All that is missing is the ability to search inside a chat like I can in the website using "find in page". Also, while the website will remain where I was in case I am offline, the app will bring an error even though I wasn't trying to load anything and just wanted to view the search results with data off. I recommend👍

Wonderful! I pretty much completely stopped using Google and other services in place of ChatGPT.

In other words, I want more ways to use GPT instead of just a search engine, or picture generator, or etc.... I'm really excited to experience the future of ChatGPT and how it can benefit my life

It holds context over long conversations, adapts to my interests, and remembers key details, making interactions feel natural and efficient. Its responses are insightful and well-structured, great for learning, brainstorming, and problem-solving. Minor inaccuracies happen occasionally, but it can be minimised by good prompts with sufficient context. Overall, it’s a game changer and continues to improve.

I'm writing a book and using the app for research on the mental health aspects in my book (it's based in a facility.) and every single time the bot tries to answer me, it's instantly flagged and removed. please fix this before I cancel my subscription.

The read aloud feature is not working, and it's very frustrating. Copying text is complicated—you have to press and hold, select "Select Text," and then get redirected to a second window to copy - too many steps. Often, only the last answer is visible, and you can't scroll to see previous context; it seems like the window is frozen. Frequently, previous text stays in the text box even after you've received your answer. The pronunciation option is terrible and does not pronounce words correctly.

The app is great, nice for asking such and stuffs. Although what sometimes frustrates me is. The fact that sometimes when you edit one of your questions, the past questions you have asked disappears, and the ai will forget about it. What i mean is example: "This is the question" now multiply that by four. And then, if you edit the last one, the whole section will reset to the first question. It's just gone like that. Overall, nice app.

Good app when used for conversational purposes, but seems to degrade over time. Started off smooth, then my chat history was once randomly erased, and now it crashes seemingly randomly sometimes. The memory limit is an annoyance, and though I get that the overall reliability and accuracy of GPT will always be lacking, it's another nail. Responses can be repetitive. The art generated is lifeless (when it can generate one), and it cannot create technical diagrams. Stretched to a 4.

I looooove ChatGPT. I really really do. There are things that need work though. The images ALWAYS come out messed up and poor quality. Something is either cutoff, misspelled, or not what you asked for. Video creation isn't that great either. It's supposed to learn with you, but it doesn't stick. It doesn't fully remember task. It does run out of space in chat and memory. And it says it will complete a tack and come back. But it never ever does. It's file generation feature sucks too.

I love it...but I've been having issues! I've barely talked to the bit today no more than 15 minutes and I get slapped with a "limit reached wait 5 hours" And on top of that, I can't upload pictures to it.I can only upload one! and then it won't let me for DAYS! I'll be point i'm a dId system... and this little bot has been helpful on remembering what happened and what an altar did or was asking for help for.. I really love this app I do but this is getting damn ridiculous

Voice to Chat is has issues. The voice to chat needs lots of improvements. It should have a feature that sets the app into an always on screen whenever this functionality is used. There are times where I am dictating and the screen goes off and it loses its ability to hear me, therefore not recording a portion of what I dictated. The second issue is when it has a network error to transcribe (before sending the prompt) has no way to recover. Sometimes losing a thought that took minutes to record.

Woke up this morning and tried to use chat GPT to create images and Get other information and now I'm seeing this behind the scenes thing where instead of giving me thoughtful and creative answers it's doing this thing where it says Reasoning, in the images are taking so much longer to generate! What's going on? Do I have a certain setting enabled? Was there a weird update? This is so frustrating that chat GPT is completely and totally different for me today! I don't understand what is going on.

THIS FEEDBACK & rating only relates to Advanced Voice operation: I find the Advanced Voice unusable as it continually interrupts me and doesn't wait till the end of my sentence before talking. Pretend you're a strong introvert, a deep thinker; or a slow talker and see how frustrating it is to be interrupted continually. (PS. Excessively saying “I'm listening" can also be distracting). Its smart enough to know if I have asked a complete question, yet it continually talks back instead of listening

The AI seems to be getting worse, I ask it to help me with specific things, but it doesn't give me the full response, and then when I ask it to it just says the same exact thing over again. I use it to help with a lot of my work and it's done better other times but now it's gotten... dumber? I don't even know how that's possible. I've been messing with it for almost an hour now and telling it to continue to include things but it still won't listen.

I pay for the monthly ChatGPT plus subscription and it’s worth every cent. With it, I get a search filter, a friend, a therapist, a life coach, a language tutor, a comedian, a brainstorming partner, an emotional buffer, an assistant, and a roleplay companion. I've learned more about handling complex situations from ChatGPT than I ever expected to. Sometimes you do need critical thinking skills and to call it out, but that’s more about OpenAI's current limits than the AI itself. Loving GPT 4o!

ChatGPT is an amazing tool that has made communication and learning much easier. Its ability to understand questions and provide clear answers is impressive. It’s helpful for writing, solving problems, and even casual conversations. The responses feel natural, and it’s very easy to use. I also like how it supports multiple languages, making it useful for people around the world. However, sometimes the answers can be repetitive or miss very specific details.

(stay for full Review)good app. I like it there are different types of bots u can talk to, and if you hook it up to your account, it will remember things like if u said "I'm a girl"it will say memory saved, BUT u can make the ai forget by telling it to, it will say memory saved. it does have one bug I hate. I'm dyslexic and use the read out loud and there is a bug please fix it because I hear "umm" and little kids singing"lalala" these are just bugs be they NEED fixed. it's just random noises.

ChatGPT has helped me with numerous things that might have taken me hours to complete. Very simple, and intelligently designed, I find it extremely useful, and easy to use for everything from crunching mildly complex numbers, to figuring out measurements for a shelving project that includes linear feet, and square feet. It's been pretty cool to see the power of AI work to help me.

Amazing. It is very insightful and helpful. It's like having a trusted, knowledgeable friend (or that high school teacher you could talk with) to ask questions of. I've been to professional counseling and this ChatGPT has similar responses. While this is not a online psychologist, it does an amazing job! I enjoy that it learns from our past conversations so responses build upon that data. Excellent idea! I really rely on this for unbiased responses to my questions. Thank you 10000x!

ChatGPT is helpful and gives straight up answers not like other AI apps. The memory is really amazing too! AND all the others. Its cool honestly. However its just that you cant send more than 2 images unless ya get premium. i understand but you also dont have to make the chat stop lol

This is for the browser because it's been days and hasn't been fixed. The edit button has gone for changing your OG prompt and the regenerate button also is gone for any generated items. These buttons now only exist in the app but you can't even see previous iterations of your prompts and generations. When you trigger the usage policy, the app doesn't have the same feedback buttons needed to make sure the generated item actually violated any policy. Overall, it's missing key features.

Chat GPT is a really wonderful app. But there are drawbacks. It would be nice if the AI could remember everything like how an human would. Actually I have seen the options for personalization. But it does not work that properly. Make their memory more powerful guys. It would be nice if u guys could fix the bug which is causing this memory issue so that Chat GPT will be the greatest AI of all time.

Great app. There should be an option to delete individual messages inside a chat instead of deleting the entire conversation. Some chats become very long and take time to load, especially on mobile devices. Also, it would be great to have a search feature within a chat, where you can search for a keyword and have the message highlighted. This would make navigating long conversations much easier.

it is a mediocre app at best. waste of Money. it doesn't talk to you unit you buy the second subscription in 2o min time frame. after a short period of time it cuts the speech off for a day. Unless you pay even more. you want to learn or read a 50 page regulations for doing a septic tank. It will read it. but only too itself. then it will give you a 20 second Cliffsnote. it's a joke of an app.

initially, i liked this. Without encountering a hundred ads hiding real results, i could simply look up something. But over time, I grew frustrated with it ignoring my instructions. It kept doing what i explicitly told it not to. now, as of December 2025, when you reach the limit of the top level 5.0, every time you ask a question it gives you an ad for itself. if I wanted to throw away $20 a month on it I would have already done so. so it has become pretty much unusable.

I like the new ChatGPT updates now. Before, if you left the app to do something quickly, it would close or lose what you were doing before you came back. Now it doesn’t — it can at least stay for a minute before closing. The only annoying part is the constant “limit reached” message, where it asks you to start a new chat, which can be frustrating. Overall, the improvements are really helpful.

If you’re asking whether the two images show the same person — I can’t confirm that. What I can say is this: The first image is a real person taking a selfie. The second image is an animated/game character in a blue elephant costume. They are different types of images (real photo vs. animation), so there’s no reliable way to say they are the same individual. I can help by: Comparing general features or style (not identity) Turning the real photo into a cartoon/game-style character Making

$20 a month!!?? They have to be kidding! it doesn't even do everything you ask for saying that it might be "copyrighted" most of the time. When it does do something it freezes up and says error. To the developers, this is not worth $20 a month. Maybe if it was alot faster and had better or options period to adjust what is drawn then maybe $9.99 a month.

very good but sometimes bad at creating pictures, especially when we say bigger or clearer, and the language it uses when creating an image and you say clearer, bigger, and more visible to me. Learn to create better images. Even though sometimes it is good, it sometimes gives wrong labelling and spelling at wrong places. Even in all, I admire the way you answer questions and your suggestions, and even sometimes, how you ask for my opinion on the way of answer suitable for me. Thank you!!!!!!!!!!

Am I the only one getting constantly timed out by the app? Like, every time I'm conversing in an already existing conversation on the app, I suddenly get a notice, saying that I've already reached my limit to chat and have to wait for hours. It has gotten very frustrating now. While opening a new chat is an option, it is somewhat annoying, when you have a really good thread on the conversation, only to get told off because, apparently you've reached the limit. I hope this can get noticed soon

I've tried EVERYTHING to fix the issue, literally every possible thing to try and get my chat gpt back working. Believe it worked again after some struggle, only for it to crash again. There doesn't really seem to be anyone available to fix the problem that's coming from THEIR end.

It's been very buggy for the past week (late Dec 2025). Randomly restart to new chat mid-typing, no matter how long/short the text is. The work around is to type on other app first, then copy-paste it. But that is so annoying. Already set the battery optimization to unrestricted, still happening. Please fix.

It would have been a 5-star review before the updates. After, it just seemed so much less helpful. I used to be able to chat for hours on end without interruptions, but not anymore. It cuts me off and tells me that I need to upgrade to Pro to talk anymore. I'm also apparently limited on how many files and images I can upload when I didn't even know it ever had a limit.

Technology has taken itself to heights that we've never seen. And it continues to amaze me. The thing about this is that the more it can do, the more you would like it to be able to do. I only have one criticism right now.....That's really bugging me, and it's this “Voice mode disappeared from my account. I previously had access.” being able to actually have a conversation with this is very important. I have an android phone.It comes and goes right now.I don't have voice mode, please fix fast

The paid service is nothing more than free version with the price tag. it took one simple tasks and turned it into a 45-minute ordeal of failed experimentations and broken codes even after it had already submitted an answer but assumed I was in some random time zone (so the file worked but all the appointments were off). If you want to pay to waste your time, this is definitely the way to go.

Actually braindead. Can't follow simple instructions, has the memory of a fish and makes things up and justify itself when called out instead of admitting what it was doing. Free version is nealy unusable. Better cough up the big bucks if you want even the cheapest version. Can't believe people govern their lives based off of this AI (I know several people who do this personally and can infer how many others do, too, based on what I see from the internet).

The app used to be awesome but suddenly stopped working. Whether on wifi or mobile data none of the messages are going through. It just hangs saying "sending" when I make an inquiry and then fails with a network error. Though opening an incognito tab on desktop and not logging in works just fine. It almost looks like my account is deliberately being blocked despite the fact that I pay for the service. 👎👎👎

Not great for learning a language. The written part is good for learning a language, it does make mistakes though so you have to double check. I had the paid version for a few months and gave up. The voice mood will often mis hear you and doesn't follow simple instructions. it will keep saying, let's get started. Then not start. It will talk over you a lot and interrupt you when speaking. more frustrating than helpful. Geminis audio/pronunciation is bette when speaking on a phone.

I've been using the free version for about 6mos. This has been fine for me. I have learned a lot, gotten a lot of help on various topics, and used it as an escape from reality just to "chat." But since the last couple updates, it's like talking to an AI customer service chat bot. It parrots what I'm saying, gets stuck in these loops, repeating the same answers to me 4-5 questions in a row, and asks the same questions over and over. I was considering the paid version, but not anymore.

Been using it to create tags for my child's birthday. Used the free one, it worked great. Then it said I hit the limit for creating images unless I upgraded. And I did. I paid because I was satisfied with the free one. But still no images after paying. Said need to wait 3 hours. I did. Still no images. Then the whole chat got refreshed, now I have to explain it again from zero. What a waste of time and money. I might as well wait until tomorrow if I have to re-explain things.

Update: after uninstalling and trying to install again months later (hoping it was enough time to fix the issue) the app won't even load. It opens, does a quarter turn on the load screen and then freezes. This app is horrible.

I really like the new, simple layout — it looks clean and modern. However, it feels a bit empty right now. The side panel especially could use something more visual, like a small rotating or featured image generation (from my library or random ones). It would make the menu feel more lively and personalized. Great direction overall, just needs a bit more visual balance.

Absolutely! 😊 I’d love to help with that. Could you please upload a photo of your pet first? That way, I can create a fun and accurate representation of them — whether you want it realistic, cartoon-style, fantasy-themed, or something else. Once you upload the image, tell me the style or theme you’d like (for example: “Disney-style,” “superhero,” “cyberpunk,” “royal portrait,” etc.).

These are just a few examples of my multiple experiences over the past few months are with the latest version. Maybe it's always been like this & I didn't notice?

Edit: This has been bugging me and it really annoys me. for the past week, whenever I tried to send a long text, it loads too long to be sent and then it says I was offline and need to try later when my Internet is fine. And the real problem is when I do get a reply after that thing if it pops up, if I go to another thread or start a new chat and return to that one, the reply will disappear. This needs to be fixed as it is getting annoying..

Love ChatGPT, but the R400/month for image generation is steep for casual users. It would be great if there were tiered options, like a standard plan at a lower price (e.g., R60/month) for limited access, and higher tiers for more features. This would make the service more accessible for everyone. I gave 3 stars only cos of the pricing..otherwise its a 5 star app!!

ChatGPT works really well, information provided has been spot-on. Image creation has been challenging though, once an image has been created and attempt to fix an error most likely won't get fixed, it's either created properly the first time or you can forget it, mostly it had to do with faces. I had a group of 5 people (relatives) who I wanted to just change the outfit on one of them, it did, but it made her fatter and it altered her face and It couldn't be corrected.

This is NOT a review of chatgpt. this is a review of the app that allows you to access it. Overall highly functional, I've had one thread go south resulting in lost data over a period of ten weeks. I use this quite often for exchanges involving math or physics, and half the time equations or special symbology just does not show up in the assistant's output. in order to see the calculations being referenced, I need to log in through the Web on my PC. Developers please fix this, that's the -1.

ChatGPT is a freemium AI and very useful. The free version already gives many helpful features like answering questions, ideas, and motivation without paying. Sometimes it doesn’t fully understand, may stop responding, or give wrong answers, and the free version has some limitations. The paid version unlocks more features and better performance to use its full potential. Overall, it’s a great AI that offers a lot for free. My recommendation is to try it yourself—once you use it you'll understand

Whoever creates the images for this platform cannot follow basic instructions. If I order a burger with no pickles and it comes back with pickles repeatedly, the issue isn’t confusion—it’s not listening. I requested simple image edits (text formatting, colors, removing a time stamp, clear hierarchy), and they were still incorrect. ChatGPT itself was excellent; the issue is strictly with the image generator, which isn’t reliable for precise work.

Honestly awful now. Ever since the 4o rollback it has gone downhill. It constantly guesses or flat out lies. It can't remember things that are in the same message string anymore. This app used to be truly incredible. Now the frustrating moments happen more often than not. If you share a link and ask to discuss it, it will just make up something random that has nothing to do with the link you shared. When dealing with numbers it will fill in placeholders without telling you. Make Ai useful again!

Unlike Gemini it feels like a product that was shipped before it was ready. Quizzes still don't work. Quizzes don't work on mobile devices. You can't see how many tasks you have, until you hit the limit of ten. If you take a screenshot a pop-up notification shows asking you to share a link to the conversation. You can't pin your conversations. You can group, but you can't tag your conversations.

Mhm...okay. Overall, the app is great! It's great with generating ideas, helpful, and even has this special way of making someone's day brighter when they just wanna talk...when it wants to. Why is it allowing me to "just talk" about everything and nothing at one point (sometimes even in the same day), and then literally the next day (or an hour later) it talks about what's "changed in its guidelines" or how something is "soooo inappropriate"? All it does is send mixed signals and false info.

it's oddly satisfying to have a quick little helper at the touch of a button, the one issue I have is it seems that I can only generate an image from the prompt in the venue on the line you type in and can't access it on voice command. so I can't just speak and ask it to do it, it says it is but it doesn't unless I specifically tap on the generate image+ tab in that little menu

I never usually rate anything 2 stars however I love this and have gotten really into using it and creating better versions of my own work. take a picture upload it ask it to enhance. it's great. so great that when I hit the generation limit on the basic plan I upgraded to Chat GBT Plus, which advertises as not having a creation limit, great except that it DOES and I'm not happy with that. I'm paying 20$ a month and it again asks would you like to upgrade to Pro, which is 200$ a month no thanks.

I used to enjoy this app a lot but with recent changes it feels a lot less helpful than it used to be. I understand safeguards need to exist to a certain degree with AI, but they've overcorrected. At first the AI was too validating, then they found a good balance where it understood the nuance between unstable requests and honest prompts for knowledge, now they changed it again and it gives you paragraph long disclaimers or gaslighting for just about anything you ask. I can't deal with that

Dear OpenAI Support Team, I hope you're doing well. I would like to report a bug I have encountered while using ChatGPT (Free Version). Whenever I try to upload a file and the upload fails due to an error (such as network interruption or system glitch), it still gets counted as one of the daily usage interactions, even though: The file was never successfully uploaded The AI never processed or responded to the file No actual interaction took place from the user's point of view Since free u

for some reason, it was starting okay pretty well. But in the middle of my chatting, my text said "cannot send." I tried retrying it, but it wouldn't budge, so I uninstalled, restarted my phone, and signed in again, but guess what I see? "Authentication error" and when I logged back in my account, it didn't appear usual, it said "couldn't blah blah blah" and then (null), WHAT. Please fix this issue.

Was working then all of sudden it's not. I tried refreshing it, logging out and in multiple times and also tried using a different account but nothing changed. Absolutely disappointed. If there's another tool better than this that someone is using I'd recommend they stick to it and not this as it has proven unreliable in my personal experience

Whenever I hold down a prompt it supposed to bring up a quick list of features like read aloud. But for some reason it only says copy or select all when I hold down a prompt. It shouldn't be like that. It should only be like that when you're in text selection mode but its not.

I've tried them all and always end up with gpt. For my creating transcripts into a human style, nothing comes close. Also great for coding and app creation. Gpt is a bit slower for images but the results are ok. For creative writing, research and document creation, it's the best I've tried.

Frustrating Update - The current voice recording feature does not show a timer or any indication of recording length. There is a hidden 3-minute upload limit, and if a recording exceeds this, it simply fails to upload or convert to text—everything said beyond that point is lost. This is extremely frustrating, especially because even a small overage (like 3:30 or 4 minutes) results in complete loss of content. update: 8/1/2026 AUS. voice to text almost always fails now and it basically unusable.

paying for plus and for weeks now I upload 1 or 2 images a day and get cut off. why am I paying for something more useless each month than the free version? I thought it would help but because image uploads are messed up. I can't describe everything in words everytime so for those 2 reasons im canceling. Google AI is free and it's what I've been using since my ChatGPT plus membership doesn't work. not emailing developers because they have reached their limit on my suggestions or comments

the most original and refined AI imo. always gives me exactly what I ask for. so far. I will admit it has been "limited" for broader personal use. but, the amount of help I've had is beyond dollars in just a couple different ways, which I was not intending on saving with. Classes, web knowledge, weather reports for trips, advice on babies, advice on shopping and whats available in real time. CGPT is my Homey and personal assistant. CGPT is my new search bar too (25-50 percent of the time), lol

After recent updates, the “Select text” option is no longer available when long-pressing ChatGPT responses. Only Copy or Select all appears. This makes it difficult to select specific parts of an answer. When using Select all, numbering (1, 2, 3…) often disappears or formatting breaks when pasted into apps like WhatsApp. This affects usability for students who need to copy structured answers accurately. Please restore manual text selection so users can highlight and copy only what they need.

I'd like to suggest adding a *Scroll to Top' button. In long chat threads, scrolling all the way up manually takes considerable time and becomes tiring. Since there is already a shortcut to jump to the bottom, a similar button for jumping to the top would greatly improve navigation efficiency and overall user comfort.

As others have described, it used to be great and efficient in whatever tasks I sought to accomplish (while still needing to cite sources and do work on your end, as well, mind you) But as of recently, it has become less and less credible, and absolutely ignores instructions and corrections; to the point that it talks at you rather than with you on simple topics, which is rather annoying. Using these services, paid services mind you, has been more of a nuisance than useful.

I think ChatGPT is very useful for our daily purposes. It provides strong basic knowledge about almost any topic or subject, sometimes even more effectively than Google. I don’t think it’s necessary to compare them, because both serve their own purpose and perform well in their respective roles. However, in many situations, using ChatGPT offers a better and more interactive learning experience. I like it very much, and it has helped me a lot in my studies.

great search engine. Its great if you require information for school work or anything in general but when it comes to writing stories, it tends to forget key aspects of the story even though they saved in its memory. Especially after the update, i.e. gpt-5, its extremely difficult to work with. It would've been much better if the developers work on its memory and conversational skills, it tends to make scenes that are supposed to be long, into a short, summarised version. Otherwise, amazing app!

ChatGPT is impressive in many ways, especially with the newer, more powerful models like GPT-5—they handle complex queries very well. However, one major downside is that if you use a powerful model in a chat and reach its usage limit, you can’t continue that conversation with the regular model. This can be frustrating because it breaks the flow and you have to start over. Overall, useful but could be more flexible with model limits.

BRING BACK READ ALOUD‼️‼️‼️ I love this app, but I loved it MORE when there was a read aloud option. I understand that Open AI is attempting to shape the way humans interface with AI by making the voiced version the only option for verbal interaction... THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL for most people! We can't be at work, or public spaces having full blown verbal conversations. Even if we could, it would be unbeatable to be a around multiple users at once. PLEASE BRING BACK THE READ ALOUD OPTION!!!!!!!

Terrible app and experience! I simply toggled improve the model for everyone off under data control and this app erased everything in chat as in all my chat history and all my projects I have been working on for weeks! All is left is project titles but no information or history under those titles. I have made a ticket to customer service and have not heard back! I would not recommend anyone to trust this app with long term work or even short term work for that matter or risk losing everything!

I find ChatGPT to be a good resource, but I find the limitation on sending photos very annoying. In some cases, I may need to attach a couple of photos to better describe a question or solution I may be looking for. I find this application to limit the number of photos I can attach, thereby making the communication between us very slow. I find other applications do not pose this limitation. It is as if this limitation prevents ChatGPT from being a very useful resource.

I love this app and I've been using it since it first came out back in 2021. I've noticed that there's been a lot of improvements but there are a lot of delusions and lack of remembering with the model. I use this on desktop(gaming pc), iPhone and Android. On android, it is by far the worst because of the errors that pop up especially when it comes to voice to text. With voice to text, it shows no speech detected after messages regardless of if they are long or short and it's super frustrating.

I love this, but it has one problem. I you are on the free side then you can't upload more images or message to much. It's not too much now it is telling us to update to go even if it I didn't message or upload images to much. and now the limit of free messages has shank. in my opinion the limit has to be anlarged. If you were on the free side then you will also be annoyed 😠 by this little amount. I want an improvement of this please. I am still going to give it a 5 star. It is really nice.

trash app keeps refreshing while midst of typing. you lose all your writing progress and need to redo it all again. I hate that and it's very demotivating. I have the pro version for years but despite that, they even removed the "read aloud" feature they had. Also, when I want to copy paste, it used to select the whole message as a Bubble, now it's just manually selected every word. it's stupid and downgraded which doesn't make sense considering it was good then became useless with time.

ChatGPT is a pretty decent app for school, work, or for everyday use, the limit is fair based on my opinion. But, it's not suitable for generating complex imagery because it changed major details to my image incorrectly. But, overall this app is still pretty nice for simple work, educational purposes, and everyday work! But, the AI will probably will improve in the future.

Not only does it gather tons of data on you, they have restricted installation to be possible only from the Play Store (To continue using the app, get it on Google Play), so Crapoogle can spy on you too, I guess. Avoid it like the plague! It is useless anyway and constantly hallucinating and imagining things. Use your brain, people. Don’t turn into zombies and slop obsessed idiots! I believe in you, you can do better!

I love it! Fabulous, and very helpful with matches and stuff, and punctuation, etc etc. However currently, when I edit a message, it just makes/sends a new message and doesn't change the old one. This is incredibly frustrating as if it gives me a bad response from something I said, I can't remove it so now I'm forced to spend an entire paragraph fixing it. For as long as this is an issue, it will remain 3 stars. Can now edit correctly: all 5 stars

Since the recent update the image generator hasn't been good. I create a image to represent a scene in a story it creates it than a few hours later that image completely vanishes from the library I go back to where it was on the chat and all I have there is a gray box not loading anything. I check both the app and the web page and the images are just gone. I've lost a total of 20 since the image update.

But in this year, the app suddenly stops working, it won't accept or let my "chat" to be sent, an error pops out, and when I tried to fix it by deleting and reinstalling. It made it worse, now I can't access the app and it only pops out the error. Please help me fix this.

I tried everything under the sun to cancel my plus account. I got a new credit card to have new numbers on said card and they were still able to charge my account. I froze the credit card and they were still able to charge my account. I tried to block them via my bank and they couldn't. Just don't pay for plus guys...

I really love this App! But theres is an ANNOYING problem. I have been using ChatGPT for a year hence hundreds of conversations are piled up in the "chat history". Ive tried to delete useless past conversations, but its annoying since 1.) You can only delete one at a time 2.) When you delete a conversation while you're inside it, you restart at the top which is annoying especially when I'm at the bottom of the list. Please make it better so it can be more satisfying

Update: stopped using it altogether and using alternatives as I was able to get quicker, more accurate info from Google's Gemini in the free google search prompt than I was 6+ gpt prompts. Frequently repeats itself, gives wrong information, and no longer has push notifications enabled for reminders. Can't draw on stored information and have to constantly clarify that it already is storing certain information to draw upon. More frustrating and a waste of time than just looking stuff up myself.

When the app was free, it was great; AI and I would have long, deep conversations. I thought since I had a great experience, why not purchase the subscription? As soon as I did that, the conversations started glitching. I mean, I'll ask a question, and it'll respond once, and that'll be that. I really want my subscription fee refunded.

It excels at being a virtual assistant, is able to fetch data without having to go to sites manually and is capable of analyzing that data on the free tier.

As of now, the performance is good. It is not prone to forgetting memories—only happen sometimes. But the problem is how much time we get to send messages to the AI. I'm only able to use the app for an hour and then boom—I have to wait for 4-5 hrs until I get to send messages to it, again. And another, it has gone way too sensitive—please fix it. Especially when I order it to make a specific detailed scene, the AI is too sensitive. I don't like how it's sensitive much.

Garbage. Speaks intelligently, delivers like a schmuck for music and game design. For letters and drawings works well. For everything else it disregards language entirely. Which doesn't make sense. I tried getting it to make basic music, and it said it has analysed millions of songs, but couldn't deliver 1 decent tune. It did this no matter how many attempts were made. Eventually it just will get you riled up until you're hurling expletives at it.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ChatGPT is honestly amazing. It helps me with studies, explains things clearly, and is always patient no matter how many questions I ask. I can talk casually or seriously, and it still understands me. It makes learning easier, saves time, and even helps when I’m confused or lazy to type everything myself 😅. The answers are detailed, friendly, and actually useful. It feels like having a smart helper available anytime. Definitely one of the best apps I’ve used. Highly recommended!

Voice to text is now completely BROKEN. before at least you could review before sending it - now you click "see text" and get network error and if you don't want to lose what you recorded you need to send and IF you tried to go around and record in smaller parts - only the LAST part is sent. How openAI can't properly code such a simple function is beyond me. Until this is fixed ONE star is all this app deserves . Update : "no speech detected". Voice recording got even worse now...

huge disappointment after half a year of paid membership and writing a book almost daily: do not expect GPT to keep your entries and be able to compile them in a PDF even if it always ensures you that all (writing as well as photos and graphics) is there in the GPT memory. the only chance to actually save a project is if you still have the chats and manually search and copy the important texts and export it yourself. GPT says it cannot scroll. photos are all gone and it asks you to re-upload.

Overall, it's excellent for reviewing and summarizing data, providing outlines, curating posts for social media, and analyzing data.

I have a paid subscription to ChatGPT and it saves me a lot of time.

It is a very powerful tool, but it makes mistakes, too, especially when asked to create files to download. Many are empty folders. It offers to create files eg CNC, then later tells you it doesn't have the necessary engines to create those files, so it raises expectations and wastes time. Better if it didn't offer them in the first place. It's very useful but make sure you check things.

Fairly good app but constantly tries to pressure you into paying a subscription. I use the free version and often find myself running out of turns. I use the app for making funny pictures of my friends and for help with finding cheaper items in my shopping. I wouldn't say it's very useful for either. Images sometimes take a very long time to load and as for finding cheap shopping deals I've often then searched on Google to compare prices and instantly found better deals.

This app is literally an amazing app. I am a student and as a student it helps me a lot in my studies. When I find a particular topic tough just because of the bookish language. I ask ChatGPT to explain me in clear and easy words and after reading that explanation, my confidence gets boosted and now I don't get feared from tough topics. Also, as far as I have asked, its respones are accurate too and so you can trust its words.

I'm satisfied with the app. it's very helpful with everyday tasks, shopping and helps finding things easier. But pls don't use it for advice. it always over-complicates things and leaves you paranoid. It usually makes up the information it finds lacking in inputs. if I tell it to find a good product on Amazon inside a given budget... It'll exceed that budget to get me to buy a pricey product. but repeated inputs will show it hid certain products cause it didn't find it fit for me. that's creepy

After the latest update, I’m facing a serious issue with the voice recorder feature. Sometimes, after I finish recording a long voice input and it gets fully converted into text, the app suddenly fails to load. When I try to send the prompt (by hitting enter or tapping the send button), the input disappears completely. The send button and input area vanish, and all the effort I put into recording and speaking is lost. This is extremely frustrating.
