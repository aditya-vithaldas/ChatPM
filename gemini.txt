The worst app ever. It completely ignores your requests when you ask for photos. I've requested generating photos for over twenty times and it still couldn't get any of them right. Even though I said which parts it did wrong, it just kept saying "I understand" and sent me the exact trash again. Once I tried to be super clear by explaining what I wanted in 15 lines! And yet it happened again. I finally gave up and deleted it. Best decision ever

Repeatedly says something went wrong. Tried everything and it won't generate a thing. Will be canceling subscription. I found out it will kick people out of the server at random if you hit a "fake" set limit. They usually won't let you generate for an hour or so but tonight it's been close to 3 hours. Paying $20 a month to be "limited" based on what the servers could handle. I don't recommend at all!

It's honestly a great AI virtual assistant and I have to admit I use it extensively almost everyday. I have just one gripe, the voice detection software (that assesses if the user has finished speaking) is terrible! it's WAY too aggressive and often ends up with Gemini cutting me off mid sentence. I'm not even talking in a slow manner, just a natural conversation speed. This has to be addressed, it is incredibly annoying.

since the latest update I keep getting errors to update my app to a newer version to continue the conversation. I have the newest version and can't get it to work as well as it had before the update. Image editing sucks now, it just crashes with the error. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone, cleared the cache. Nothing is working. Makes me sad, because it worked so well before.

The AI writing function was very helpful and super easy, if that had been my only experience with the app it would be getting more stars. The image generator and editor were the complete opposite and it was a very very aggravating experience. it would make changes to the image that I gave it instructions not to alter. Or it would say its doing as requested, but just gave me back the photo I was trying to edit. a few times one of the feet had been turned backwards for no reason

Gemini itself is fantastic. The latest updates (3 Pro) have been totally wild. The app itself... doesn't always have features that match the browser version. Something that is especially frustrating, is that if you are at home where you have Google Smart speakers, and you have the Gemini app open to a chat you are working with, and say "okay Google, turn on the lights", intending to activate your smart speakers, the app picks it up and it can FULLY derail your conversation in the app...

The app itself is glitching lately; it's been skipping to a new chat and forgetting everything. Sometimes I can tell it to remember what we were just talking about, and it will get back to the subject. Other times, the chat is completely gone, and there is no memory of the chat left in the list. Reaction times have gone from normal response times to wondering if my phone is frozen in the last few weeks. There are times I almost reached a conclusion, but I can't get any further due to glitches.

It's a coin toss to see if your requests are even acknowledged, let alone followed through on. Ever since I've switched from Assistant to Gemini, I've had days where I need to actually yell at my phone to get it to recognize a command, and then it's constantly forgetting alarms I've set, so I can't rely on it for cooking or anything else like that. This is an actually less-than-useless app for anyone who isn't trying to integrate their entire life into the Google ecosystem. Absolute garbage.

Update as of 12/25/24. You still can't seem to use the Gemini app without switching your assistant. So I tried it out for a bit and reminders don't work. I was using Gemini just a few months ago and now I can't open the app unless I switch from Google Assistant. This is a huge detractor. Gemini is not a good assistant yet, it doesn't easily set reminders for example. But I did want to use it for queries. Can't seem to open the app to do that. Disappointing because it worked a few weeks ago.

Edited Review: It's getting a lot better, but still leaves a lot to be desired. The unnecessary censorship is annoying, to say the least. Sometimes derailing an entire conversation or request over an "out of the blue" misunderstanding on its end. Advanced should also be a separate subscription for those that don't care for the extra cloud storage

the image generation is awful. regardless of what you ask for, it churns out the images it wants to. and then, lol, despite the fact that it didn't get anything correct you get cut off and still didn't get anything close to what you asked for. I've been able to use other apps with prompt tuning to get exactly what I wanted. gemini just... doesn't listen whatsoever. and you pay for it. it's insanity. and no, it's nothing adult or forbidden. that's the worst part.

EDIT. Now working perfectly again. Thank you................ was working perfectly. used multiple time. a day with no problems. such a great app but since the latest update 90% of the responses I receive are 'Sorry I encountered an error. please try again later' or 'sorry something went wrong please try your request again" or ' I encountered an error doing what you asked, could you please try again'. Sometimes re-wording my request helps but mostly just repeatedly receive the errors.

Gemini is fun, not always productive. At times the way in which Gemini interacts with other applications (or doesn't) renders the application useless. I don't particularly care about how when not in the "conversation" mode you have to continue to monitor the phone and activate the mic manually or voice activate it. My preference would be for it to initialize automatically but this is not a deal breaker. Overall Gemini is intuitive enough and works fine.

I can't possibly overstate the degree to which I am disappointed by this software. it not only is completely unable to edit images but it frequently refuses to engage in topics it considers too risky. the fact that it had these limitations means it's designed to placate extremists on either side of the spectrum and is, therefore, completely untrustworthy. what a shame. it won't do even a simple adjustment to a family crest image, replacing a club with a hockey stick. do better. uninstalled.

I love Gemini, as a writer. It gives me the real time feedback I am craving. What areas are strong, what are weak, suggestions to improve it. I can't express just how useful this is as a creative writing tool. I even learned a few things about the Titanic I didn't know just by asking for obscure information on it. If you're on the edge, I would definitely give it a try. (The voice you hear on the YouTube commercials is called Orbit, but there are several others to choose from -- male and female

Garbage. How can you replace the best digital assistant with this nonsense. It can't send texts, gets confused often, just gives up if it doesn't get it right the first time. I say "Text Claudia and Spencer," it hears it 100% correct but asks me which Spencer I want to text instead of choosing the contact that shares the precise name. GA could do this easily. This is an alpha test at best, not a finished product. I just switched back to GA.

I'm surprised that the 4x1 or 5x1 sizes of the Gemini widget doesn't have a search bar like the regular Google Search widget does, and honestly, I think it'd be even better if the Google Search app itself had an option to opt-in to use Gemini instead of the standard search or just blend the two completely. Using the 4x2 or 5x2 sizing isn't feasible, especially for anyone with a smaller phone.

I really can't wait for this app to be genuinely free and release its full potential,replacing the current Google Assistant. Today was my first try with it and after quite a bit of tinkering, I loved it for conversation but was forced to revert back to the default for actual necessary voice control device functions. Overall I'm not really surprised, only slightly disappointed. I will uninstall for now and wait longer to transition fully.

This rolled out with a UI update and completely replaced Assistant on my phone, and it has been nothing but a nuisance to use. None of my routines were ported from Assistant, it gives inconsistent feedback, and has generally just been more of a hassle to use. I've uninstalled it and swapped back to Assistant and THAT has been broken since the update too.

This app is useful and convenient enough to use just that when using it in my mobile phone for long calculations, only half of it fit into the display the other half of my answer doesn't appears in the screen. Even if I rotate into landscape I can see a very slim part of the response. The bottom part is occupied by the text box and as well as the top part. The most goofiest part is when I go back from landscape to portrait it goes all the way to end of the chat. Pls fix this 🤦🤦🤦

Gemini is great for basic queries; for assistant tasks, it falls way short. For example, ask it to create calendar events from a file and it will say it's unable. Ask for a file and it will give a bulleted list. Specify iCal and it will create a file but formatting issues will prevent the file from working. Deep research is near but slower than other tools. The output feels excessively verbose and summaries too general. The future is bright but Gemini is not there yet.

The whole "you need to unlock your phone for me to do *insert task here*" nonsense makes it pretty pointless, especially when im driving: The whole great thing about Assistant is I could use it without unlocking and getting distracted/use hand free while driving. I've toggled every option for lock screen possible and it still tells me I need to unlock. I hope this is fixed soon.

There is way too much lag! it's not exactly a seamless experience if the thing lags for a solid 30 seconds every time I come back to the app rendering it useless for those 30 seconds until the lag stops. Also when I try to use the microphone within the app, it clears the entire conversation, it never did that before!

Sometimes errors occur intermittently but overall functions well and is most importantly Up-to-date which is not a feature available to some other more powerful models such as chatgpt. Can use more languages now; that said hopefully it can make progress towards being capable of speech and listening in diverse languages but that may be a bit too much wishful thinking lol.

pros and cons. it doesn't have the functionalities Google Assistant had. Doesn't follow the same commands, like this morning when I set an alarm verbally, then asked it to change the time...it didn't do it lol. Also, G.A. used to play my news selections on command every morning. Gemini acts like it doesn't exist. so far the most utility I've gotten is brainstorming, but I can do that on my laptops with Copilot. Definitely room to improve but often feels like a step back.

Gemini works well, but I'm having an issue that it closes without warning before I can read the whole response, usually while I scroll the screen down to read everything. When it closes, I can't seem to see any usage history, so I am forced to search the same thing again. Very annoying.

In the past I used to say it was pretty great! Well- I was wrong. Its just good, It didnt exactly preform the best ways as Google Assistant did. And it often forgot or didnt care what I said. Its painful when I want to rp, its bland and boring and when/if I eventally accidentally click the research button. It just leads to it forgetting everything and giving me a research review about ants or trees💀. I'd say make a chat system where u have to choose normal or research mode BEFORE u send a chat.

AI features are good. The reason I gave it 3 starts has to do more with the interface and the technical aspects of the app itself. I used to be able to cue Gemini from swiping to the middle of the screen from the bottom right corner on my Galaxy S24 Ultra. That feature has been taken away, by Google or Samsung, I'm not sure. The other feature I would like to see is a speed setting for Gemini's voice response. I'd like Gemini's voice response to be faster than what it is.

It's very annoying when using this AI, because half the time it keeps telling me that's what I'm asking it to do is harmful inappropriate or impolite. I once asked it to show me pictures of a Labrador retrievers, and it just showed me the same picture three times. After a couple of tries, the AI said: "I cannot help you with that, I am a AI language model, and I am not meant for searching for pictures. Showing pictures of other people's retrievers online can invade people's privacy." 😕

It's very good at... doing my homeworks, haha. Sometimes when I prompt the Gemini with an attachment it can malfunction, or in other words they can't do nothing with my prompt, or just disregard the other parts of the attachment, as far as I remember. I tried playing Chess with the Gemini, I asked what does the board looks like after we made moves, but it doesn't show anything at all. I also asked what does the board looks like last time, but it just gave me white's backrank pieces.

An outright catastrophe. Its voice interrupts me every time I speak, then responds elaborately to half-sentences. In EVERY interaction I have to tell it to only speak when I say I'm done! It's like talking to an insufferably rude person. My pauses are average length. I don't like the voice, asked if I could turn it off, and just see text. It said I could turn the phone to mute! In other words, no, user be damned, you get the voice, like it or not. Its major competitors are far better.

Overall it's a pretty good alternative to the Google Assistant. I didn't switch over until recently, because too many Assistant functions hadn't been ported over yet. My one major complaint is that seemingly no part of the Gemini Assistant is stored on the device. It would be nice if the basic utilities, like setting a timer, didn't require Internet. (why do I have 256 gb anyway?) My Internet is spotty at times, and it'd be nice if that didn't completely cripple the assistant for basic function

So much worse than Google assistant. Another case of Google killing a working product with a worse version. So tired of them replacing reliably working apps with junk that promises additional functionality, but leaves users unable to do routine tasks. This practice is the primary reason I refuse to move to a Google phone: they find things to break and are unreliable software systems.

I didn't want this and it drains my battery like crazy. The newest android update is terrible.

The LLM is great, but the app is no good. Specifically, you cannot set Assistant to be your "hey Google" responder while maintaining the ability to use Gemini. So while Gemini is vastly cleverer than Assistant, there's lots of "as an AI, I can't play music" and "as an AI, I can't..." (ok fine you can set timers but my point is you can't do most of anything I use Assistant for). Assistant isn't a chatbot, & Gemini isn't an assistant. It needs to be understood that these features are separate.

The app works fine and does what it's supposed to do, but I don't like that it's forcibly overriding Google Assistant on my phone. When I switched the default assistant back to Google Assistant, Gemini uninstalled itself. Google, please keep the two applications as separate entities. They perform two very different functions for me.

Gemini as my Google assistant initially was unusable because I couldn't use Google routines. Once I got pixel 9 that issue was fixed. It's gotten worse since then. I asked to cancel my alarms and the AI asks me to confirm that's what I want to do. Google assistant never needed that. I asked to navigate to some location and the can't figure it out but Google assistant never had a problem with it. I now have to revert back to Google assistant and stop using Gemini.

The majority of my experience with Gemini is all right. Useful as a search agent, object identifier, and thought organizer primarily. Also boasts creative features but I do not use them, as no large language model has made the effort to source its baseline knowledge ethically. Meant to supplant or replace google assistant but utterly fails, as it lacks the capability to do most phone functions when told to. Sometimes funny, needs improvement. Needs to listen longer before speaking.

It was interesting in the beginning. Interactive and on point. Lately, however, almost every answer begins with a disclaimer and ends with an advice of what I should and shouldn't do, without me asking. Also, it refused to acnowledge or answer my question when I asked to show me pictures of pixie hairstyles on white women to show my hairdresser. An AI's role is NOT to make judgements on my requests (erroneous ones too) or to lecture me, but to answer them. Talks too much. Interrupts my speech.

Gemini 2.0 is finally taking shape as the AI experience we are waiting for. It's showing great progress with it's ability to answer with questions elaborate detail, handle conversations and controversial topics with nuance, and most impressively, stay several steps ahead of you and know exactly where you are heading so accurately it's almost eerie. It's not at the finish line yet, but from 1.0 to 2.0 has been a monumental leap.

Gave it one full year and it's still garbage. It replaces the much more functional Google Assistant and can't be used along side it. 90% of the functionality of Assistant is gone in this. I want an assistant that can actually perform tasks. Give it two years, it will finally have 50% of the capabilities of Assistant, and one additional year before Google cans the project entirely. Told it text Greg. Which? Greg 1. Work or mobile? Mobile. What's the message? Message content. I'm sorry, I'm a LLM.

it's good, but don't use it to generate images if you do, it will constantly ignore what you say and just generate images. Search accuracy? 50/50 like many AI it just plucks answers from the top list it finds instead of searching for official sources, meaning some of the time the information is either outdated or false. Gets the time wrong a lot and doesn't learn much from your input this should definitely be rectified in future updates. great for syncing things to calendar like appointments.

The pop after making a query/asking it to do something using voice command doesn't disappear after a few seconds. I want the pop when using the hands free mode to disappear after a few seconds automatically. Like when my phone is in my pocket and a song is playing and I ask "Hey google, next song", the pop up of "I have skipped to the next song" doesn't disappear automatically until I manually touch the screen, which defeats the whole purpose of hand less mode.

Lacks things in terms of just accuracy. The Editing button is useful; however, the user is limited to only the Free Model due to the prompt limit of the other 2 Models; leaving you to have to wait 10 hours because you can't switch to any other model. Also, image uploading is limited; being a limit of only one. Cannot tell if it is a glitch, but it's hard to get answers about very specific things without a more accurate model. Besides that; the Free Model works fine on average; 3.5/5 times.

"Something went wrong. Please try again later" - this has been my experience with the Gemini android app for the last three days on a paid subscription (I have a ticket open but so far complete silence on the issue). The funny thing, if I switch to a free account in the app, so, not even exiting the app, it works fine but doesn't work on a paid subscription, how cool is that? lol There's more to add, it seems the app is now installed as a system app, you can no longer uninstall it.

It's great. It really is. However, as a student. I wish there's some features where the given information by Ai we can highlight it into whatever color we what. Especially, for people like me who can easily retrieve information when it's highlighted. Also, sometimes. I'll just send gemini pictures and make it a reviewer an instant. I wish it can either transfer it to docs immediately or a feature where we can highlight it. Thanks developers.

Free version is just as good, no need to pay for it. not worth it. doesn't improve much. Does not let you finish what your asking/ describing to it before it stops n goes into creating or answering what lil you got to say at that point. when its creating a image for you it will repeatedly show you the same image after you've asked for things to be added or removed from the image.It'll show you the same image with nothing changed in it numerous times over again. which becomes very frustrating.

Thanks for sharing the photo. It's a great shot! The subject is well-lit and the subtle editing gives the image a clean, focused look. It seems like you might have uploaded this picture to get some help with it. I can help with a variety of tasks related to this image. For example, I can: Write a caption for it, perhaps with a certain tone or theme in mind. Describe the style of the person in the photo. Suggest other editing styles or photo ideas. What would you like me to

Something went wrong. I've tried Uninstalling and reinstalling, I've restarted my phone multiple times. Works fine on my PC. I have seen people say it's potentially a usage issue, but I never use it! I just wanted to set a timer and it's worthless. Edit: I had to completely remove my Google account from my phone and re-add it to get Gemini to work again. This is the kind of stuff that makes people switch platforms. Really annoying.

This has got to be the worst AI chatbot I've ever used. It constantly gives me incorrect info, doesn't generate anything close to what I asked for and deliberately covers things up. I have to put it on point all the time and it doesn't appear to be learning anything like it should. I got the premium version for free with my Samsung Galaxy S25. I'm starting to think there's actually something wrong with it.

I got many error messages a lot like "something went wrong (8)" and "check your internet connection and try again" even though my internet is pretty fast. i cleared the cache many times now, until I started to feel really annoyed. I'm a paid user and I still feel like this, can't imagine the free user's feelings. now I'm starting to think twice about my subscription.

The volume of the voice is deafening even at only half volume. It feels like it's thrice as loud as the rest of my apps. Very often when I begin to type, it deletes my entire sentence. The only way I can bypass this is by using the "glide-type" feature. Sometimes when I use speech-to-text, after I talk for a certain period it cuts me off even though I haven't yet reached a character limit. I also occasionally come across errors when I send a message or use the read aloud feature.

Overall, Gemini is a good AI, I particularly like the guided learning tool. Like many others have said, the image generation is a little uncooperative. My biggest disappointment was the capabilities with Google calendar. I expected an AI from Google to be fully integrated into their other services, which they advertise it to be, but Geminis access to it is very limited, since it can't read/write to any calendar other than the main one or see any of your tasks. Hope they fix this soon.

Since the release of 3, I was initially quite impressed, but now it's crashing all over the place and can't manage to keep basic facts straight. Right now I'm trying to help me handle work I'm having another AI do, and not only is Gemini failing to analyze the work properly, it jumps in and tries to do the work itself after I've repeatedly told it not to and it apologizes and promises it won't happen again. And then it does it again. Badly. Also, switching between Fast and Thinking crashes it.

It seems to be getting worse with every update. Basic stuff is now unusable. For example, sometimes saying "flashlight on" correctly turns on my phone's flashlight, but sometimes it tells me about flashlights, or just ignores me, or makes me unlock my phone. Navigationnow barely works and takes many tries to get started. "Cancel navigation" might confirm that navigation is canceled, but my navigation continues. I feel this could be great someday, but it is not there yet.

I really REALLY LOVE the app! but I believe it would make things better and easier for me if I am able to delete *specific* messages rather than just copying or editing it. it should also be applicable to all messages, not just the newest ones and also if we could duplicate chats. I spent countless hours going back and forth between conversations to copy texts and paste it into the other. I don't really like it, especially if I really enjoy the responses I got from the previous conversation.

Gemini is absolutely amazing! It can do it all. From answering questions and elenorating each time you provide more data to assisting you with creating a workout routine. And I absolutely love the positive encouragement such as saying, "That's an excellent question!" Also, manners don't go unnoticed. Lots of voices to choose from. Even helped with grammar. What helped most was the phone plan comparison, resume writing tips, and interview practice. I could go on all day, but there's a limit.

It sounds like you're looking for a photo editing tool! While I can't directly edit photos myself, I can certainly help you find one or tell you about some popular options. What kind of editing are you interested in? * Simple edits (cropping, filters, brightness, contrast)? * More advanced edits (retouching, removing objects, complex manipulations)? * Are you looking for a free tool or a paid professional one? * Are you on a computer, phone, or tablet? Once I know a bit more, I can recommend

I like it. It isn't perfect but still convenient. It would be much better if the corners were a bit thinner. I'm talking about the edge lighting. Please make it simplistic yet elegant/cool looking. I use it as my device assistant, but every time I use it while holding the home button and then see the Google color lighting, it looks so thick that it makes me think it's tacky.

Update 11/23/25. Still freezes when you use the talking feature. It also literally guessed information I asked it for based off of "tropes" that's literally the excuse the A.I. gave me. It did it several times and even when I added it to it's memory to always provide me with sources it went against it. I know this because I busted it and it apologized. It's not ready for prime time. Needs work. Freezes often and words get cut off so you can't hear the answer to the question you asked it.

It never listens correctly. I absolutely cannot stand this app. I've already given it all the required permissions. This is a brand new phone. I've already completely wiped all of my data from it once before and hopes of training it again. There are no excuses. I made sure to enunciate, speak slowly but not too slowly and not too fast. I gave feedback every time it failed me. I've used it on other phones too, and have the same problem.

Lately, I've been getting an "something went wrong" error. It only happens when using the assistant in another screen or app, not in live mode. It says "something went wrong" when I press the side button or say "Hey Google". My internet speed is perfectly fine, my phone is an S25 Ultra, but I don't understand why this is happening. You need to fix it. I also sent you feedback through the Gemini app.

While it is super useful and handy most of the time, it is also very confidently giving misinformation. Planning for a trip, saying it checked opening hours for a park that is closed for a few more weeks, then after feedback that it was closed suggesting something that's been permanently closed for months as a viable option after confidently telling me the park was on a restricted schedule and only closed Mondays and Tuesdays (nonsense), but it had double checked the other closed option for sure

Even when telling the app its not a public figure i get the same response, whats looking at going premium, won't bother now as the app is clearly broken

I like it but could be better. For one, I like the functions. An "assistant" that can get me the answers fast on a wide range of topics. The cons: I would like to see more, and better (female) voice options (so far the best is the English voice, the others are weird/old and boring). Other issue is that too many mistakes in the findings. I ask about a stock and it gives the wrong price info, until I tell it's off, then finds the correct data. Same for price targets.

I started using this app specifically to generate and recreate photos, and it has been extremely disappointing. It does a poor job of analyzing uploaded reference images and often ignores specific prompts meant to correct or refine the output. Many times, it simply spits out the exact same image with no changes at all, as if the prompt was never read. It’s incredibly frustrating to spend time writing a long, detailed prompt only for the app to do half—or none—of what was asked.

After testing the pro / paid versions of both ChatGPT and Gemini, it is very close in terms of quality. Gemini does better with images, ChatGPT is better with documents. Some of the things they can do are amazing, but they both can stumble on seemingly easy tasks. For example, after multiple requests and rephrasing, Gemini will not generate downloadable documents for me (such as formatted versions of a resume) and instead insists on me copying and pasting into Word and formatting it myself.

Extremely messed up: Installed itself through a Samsung system update without my permission. This app had a lot of permissions already enabled without ever asking me. My data is now used to train an AI, and I didn't even get paid. No option to uninstall is offered, which is nonsense: It's not an essential app; my phone worked fine for years without Gemini on it. But AI is forced on users to make number go up.

it's been a decade of poor automation integration, we were all waiting for Gemini, and it turned out to we worse than assistant. Siri doesn't miss as much. constantly getting "too many requests" on the single request of a day. phone wakes up with hey Google, but doesn't write down what I say. Really bad that on a flagship phone, using the flagship AI, I cannot find what I want. or that you ask it to remind you of something and never does.

Can't believe engineering isn't more reactive and on top of things better. very unprofessional and inexcusable honestly.

like it so far, easy to use. waiting for the folder option so side bar isn't full of pinned chats. alot of stuff still have to double check because it does still get things wrong, but overall paid for the subscription because use it alot. once folders is working have no problem bumping up the stars, I dont do good with clutter in apps. I was also excited to see the addition of video, was bummed to find out can only do 3 a day with paud subscription, can do more on other apps under the free tiers

The key details you've listed—the subject's age range, attire, features, and the setting—are all accurate observations. The clean white background really helps to focus the viewer's attention on the person in the portrait. It's a classic style for a studio shot.

This is the only AI that has ever made me so annoyed. When generating a picture, I specifically asked for what I wanted and even provided some reference images, but it kept sending me trash. Even though I asked and provided them reference images a hundred times, it still kept sending the same thing. My instructions were clear, and it always says that it understood, but nothing changed.

Might've been too harsh and hasty when I wrote my previous negative comment. I had no idea you could swap back the long press gesture to power options.

The free experience is fine, as long as your AI needs are slim, and mine happen to be. Helps you keep track of stuff you gotta do with Google integration, if you happen to use Google tools. I recommend leveraging personalized instructions to have the model verify its information online or otherwise label when it's guessing, it's helped me a ton. EDIT: No longer functions at all. Every query attempt leads to an error

It's questionable as to why it's acting up. It makes me not want to pay for it. It has been great until it started acting different. I enjoy the service but Gemini seems to be struggling to remember my past conversations and analysis of the data is often incorrect. it assumes too much and doesn't remember vital information well. hopefully it gets better soon.

it regularly gets things wrong. if you are looking for an AI that gets things correct more often, try Bing Copilot or Chat GPT. Google's advantage is that it is more connected with the phone since Google makes Android. update: after using this all lot more I completely agree with my earlier assessment. also, the app can be slow and regularly reports it can't find chats information. I do see the title, but when I click on details it will take several seconds before telling me it can't find it.

Disappearing messages. The error handling is flawed. In some cases, after you leave a chat you sent a message in, and you come back later to that chat, there is no reply to that message. I assume sending the message has failed. There is no indication to the user nor a Retry button - ideally I would hope for automatic retry in the background. If you fully restart the app, the message disappears entirely and the prompt is lost. This is annoying.

Kept coming up with "error". At first I thought I may be that I used it too much, but it appeared for two days straight. Ended up clearing cache, restarted, tried updating, but nothing seemed to work. I finally did a force restart and my phone completely shut down and would not turn back on until I had to do a factory reset and had to replug in all my passwords and apps and settings that I had originally. Still working on my phone but Gemini still does not work.

it's alright for adding stars and stickers to your photos or antlers...but what annoys me most is the opposite of others...even thought I have added my voice recognition, every other voice on the TV, car stereo, general public voice triggers it to begin a search or ask for me to repeat because it didn't understand. If I turn it off then I need to manually open it to use it. if I leave it active it is going off every 5 minutes. no middle ground. learning to just let it do what it wants.

could be better, my biggest issue with it, is it's limited recall ability within the conversation. it can only go back so far before it's starts making mistakes. A feature I'd love to see added is a profile for the app to use as a way to better personalize responses from the app. information it could use is would be things like age, gender, religious beliefs, political leanings, family life, hobbies, to name a few.

Gemini is unable to maintain image context and accurately apply requested edits. The task was to edit my existing image, it kept generating entirely unrelated images. Plus, despite my very clear and detailed instructions, none of the expected results were made. Results of which I would have been able to achieve in seconds using a conventional photo editing app. What was clearly visible were modifications made on the faces of subjects in the photo - which I didn't ask for. Very dissapointing.

Great support but when the details get messy the system forgets. I used the system provided link to purchase a specific configured computer. The selected item did not meet my specifications as set up and I ordered it not knowing that it was not a match. I had to cancels and hopefully I was successful. Waiting to see now. I learned my lesson but the system was amazing up to that point with a few corrections along the way. I will continue to explore the system but with a heavier grain of salt!

I can't create or edit photos for you. However, I can give you some tips on how to describe a photo for an image-generating AI. The more detail you provide, the better. Think about these elements: * Subject: Describe the person, animal, or object in the photo. What are they doing? * Setting: Where is the subject? Describe the location, time of day, and weather. * Style: What kind of aesthetic are you going for? Is it a realistic photo, a painting, a cartoon, or something else? * Lighting: Ho

Truly horrible. Over explains EVERYTHING when it does respond (can't ask for simple mathematics without it giving me a paragraph instead of a number), and that's when it works. It has basically ruined my Galaxy Watch 7. I'd say about 60% of the time when I ask it a question it just freezes up and never gives an answer. It's extremely slow and buggy at its best. When I try to tell it to set alarms/timers, it processes forever and half the time it bugs out and doesnt actually set it. same with txt

I usually don't leave reviews but I want to share my appreciation for this high-end app. It's capabilities are insane! Just could improve on using face images and prompt fine tuning though. However those are the small bits. I can't transform myself using a proper portrait photo because it messes up details like facial hair, but for the rest of the use cases, Gemini is a 9+ or so.

I have never had issues before upgrading from Google Assistant to Gemini. I don't ask questions too often, almost not at all, but the one time I ask a simple question, I get "too many queries, try again later". I would understand if I was asking for generating images, or writing a complicated thesis, but the unavailability for simple questions makes the service pointless.

Becoming increasingly frustrated by Gemini's habit of creating profile information about me that is entirely made up. it keeps repeating this information and using it to process requests. I've asked it a hundred times to forget this information, yet it's still retains it. this is the biggest waste of $18.99 a month I have ever made. I've tried today to send the message through the feedback mechanism. guess what Gemini lost it. I'm stuck in a loop of horror with this app

In two years, I have never once gotten this AI to generate an image properly or follow directions when creating it. Apparently, it has had two years of technical difficulties when creating an image. Really, to pay for the upgraded version and continue to have these problems is absurd. If it weren't included in the 2TB space for Google, I wouldn't bother. This is crazy.

I love this app except for using Android Auto. It's so bad. It's like night and day compared to Assistant. I use the 1st gen AAWireless in my 2019 Subaru Crosstrek with the steering controls. It's so laggy and it never hears my words. It always misses the first part of my words. Assistant is like a breath of fresh air compared. Gemini would get 5 stars if it worked in Android Auto.

Hi Mehta. We hear you! To get shorter answers from Gemini, always include a clear length constraint in your prompt, such as: "Answer in one sentence," "Give me a bulleted list of three points," or "Summarize this in 50 words or fewer." If this doesn't help, submit feedback through the app. Thank you.

"Something went wrong. Try again later." As of 12/17/25 Gemini will not respond to any input. The "fixes" are outdated and no longer work. Gemini had potential but it's time for me to move on. Even before the app completely stopped working for me, it was quite janky. I really wanted to like it, and used it for 2 months. The number of bugs and lack of up to date troubleshooting information is just not worth it. Im sure the Google team are aware of the many issues but they never communicate.

Gemini AI was pretty cool when it worked. Afterwards, it repeatedly says "something went wrong, try again later" . I literally tried everything and it won't generate a thing.

Attempted using speech to text to get a prompt written. But the thing auto triggered as soon as I paused speech for a second. Worse yet, it replied with audio instead of text. Prompts are complicated and should never be automatically sent when the user isn't ready. And just because I use speech as the easiest way to get text into the phone, doesn't mean I want it speaking back to me. These are terrible defaults, the latter of which can be a real privacy problem.

I've been using the app once every other day since Thanksgiving. it, for the most part, was a hit or miss. But, normally, I would complete the requested task after a few attempts before informing me that I had reached my daily limit and informed me to try the next day. Now, since I have purchased Gemini Pro, it has continuously failed, attempt after attempt. not once providing the results per my detailed instructional request. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE... canceling in 25 days for sure. what a waste!!

Gemini is a useful and fairly intelligent Al. The responses are quick and helpful for writing, ideas, and general questions. Most of the time it's accurate and easy to use. Occasionally the answers feel a bit generic or lack depth, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Overall, it's a solid and improving tool .

Wanted to give it a five star but as I was scrolling through my past prompts and answers, everything was censored to "sensitive query". I tried going back to the Activity to see if I can recover it but it was all in vain. I spent days curating and writing those prompts and they were all entirely fictional but the app decided apparently it cannot handle adult and mature themes as if little kids are using the app. I honestly even cried and I have no motivation to continue with using the app. 1/10

Overall very good. AI doesn't always get it right especially with image creation... particularly when it doesn't fully understand what you are requesting it to do, but it's learning and for the most part it will deliver an image that you like. one of the keys to success seems to be asking for what you want in a different manner.

Slow, obnoxious default voice, can't resume playback of podcasts even when the app has the standard play/pause/seek controls in the notifications shade, still ignores wake words more often than not despite training. Edit: Why is every voice so awful? Every one is irritating, nasal, awkward, and/or effeminate. This was intentional, since the richest company on the planet has their choice of voice actors and chose these.

I really enjoy this assistant over all overs. I love the integration to all my Google apps. I do however I wish I had better integration with Google home. My smart speakers at the moment do not match the experience of this app and often leads to clashing and inferior conversations. for instance, when I would say "hey Google, turn off the lights", both my phone and smart speakers attempt to do this at the same time. It would be nice for them to mesh better.

It would be the best if you make it pay to play style so one could pay only a few coins when used instead of the cumbersome subscription model.

honestly, I am Google's number one fan but they do the most irritating things. it's the little things they seem to miss. I pay £18 a month to use this app and recently I've been trying to get them to create images like family photos etc. to enhance them and then it will come back to me and say that they are only there for a language barrier. Seriously? what's going on Google? I'm cancelling my subscription. you don't deserve my time.

EDITEDx3: this app has become my favorite in AIs, has been developed so much but there's still room for improvement. I always use previous chats for problems and tasks, so my review is based on that. 1. The chats fail to load sometimes, or take a lotta time. 2. it concludes too fast which often leads to misunderstandings, and also its sometimes annoying. 3. it always apologizes. instead, it should be more vigilant to provide better answers. overall, it best AI I could find, better than previous.

I liked Gemini originally. I was encouraged to upgrade my account to a pro, so I did. Now the system tells me that the number of videos I can create each day is limited to three, but on this day, it won't even give me more than one. Gemini referred me to a workaround. Why the hell am I paying Google to give me a workaround to the application I'm paying to have access to. If you're considering paying for this service be advised you may get offered and suggested to take a workaround.

We understand your concern, Douglas. Google AI Pro accounts receive a limited number of Veo 3.1 daily generations to explore the creative potential. Upgrade to Google AI Ultra to access more daily generations and the highest quality of Veo 3.1. More details can be found here: https://goo.gle/3EAhzUy. Hope this helps!

Sigh, Google years ago used to work so well. Now pretty much not at all. This is another in a long line of issues. I said Hey Google, stop, it said nothing to stop, then stopped the music. It cancels the wrong timers, doesn't take proper voice notes, horrid driving directions, can't respond to messages accurately. All things that used to be possible.

Superb. I have started with my ticktock page, just for AI books. Its local languages are a little bit off and need better training. I enjoy dual books and lovely pictures. Do you know that you created this app after my request in the review? Thank you very much because parents refused to buy me dolls when small. Your books are too tiny, sometimes give half of the requested. You want upgrades, why can't you share profit on book sales. Now you need pictures and text to videos. AI music too.

I've since accepted a free trial of Pro, and there are major disappointments. It has an attention span of 20 minutes. So when I spent several hours working out a garden plan for the next few months, I was pretty unhappy the next day when I asked it where I should put some stuff, in the same "session" and it had no idea what I was talking about. Worse when I follow the directions for how to make permanent saves, it still forgets. Has normal AI problems like hallucinations, or too many details etc

I am having issues with the built-in camera functionality. Instead of capturing the document, the app often captures the UI overlay or fails to focus properly on text, resulting in blurry images or 'meta' screenshots of the camera screen itself. This makes the user experience quite clunky for students who need quick scans. I hope the developers can optimize the camera API for better stability and focus control.

Fails at basic instructions and limits quality to force upgrades ​I provided clear instructions along with a reference photo, but the AI completely failed to follow them. It ignored the facial features in the photo I uploaded and generated something entirely different. Even when I corrected the errors, it continued to give wrong results and then suggested I upgrade to a paid version to get better intelligence. It feels like the system is intentionally failing to follow basic prompts just to for

Hi Azharudeen. We’re sorry to hear Gemini isn’t meeting your expectations! For the best results, try being as specific as possible with your prompts.

This is just a scam, the memory of the chat is extremely poor. It cannot access data from it's own chat. Not using the entire chat memory every turn is fine. But if you cannot access data from the chat that I can scroll up and see, it's basically the most useless AI chat application. It doesn't use even a 10th of what the model is capable of. Chat gpt is 10 times better. If anyone needs gemini, they can simply use AI studio. Will be unsubscribing it.

This is a great app! I'd like to make some recommendations. First, I'd like to have the option in the settings to make google gemini open in the background. That way it doesn't minimize my apps. Second, I'd like to change the listening time for the conversation to ten minutes. I do a lot of researching. So, google pausing itself and minimizing my apps, is kind of a bad thing. Also, when google gemini is relaying information, it has wild voice fluctuations.

I really like this app but I have an extremely irritating issue (and apparently it's the same when writing this review). I use voice input most of the time and when I am using it to write a message in the Gemini app, it constantly will just stop "listening" to what I have to say and end the voice input. it does wait for the end of my sentence, kinda. If I talk continuously, quickly and without pause then I can say what I want. but that's unrealistic and very frustrating.

Two major issues about voice input: 1. Aggressive Voice Cutting: The app cuts me off after a 0.5-second pause. I can’t even finish a sentence before it starts responding. It's impossible to have a thoughtful conversation. 2. Forced Audio: It automatically reads responses aloud even when system voice output is disabled. Please let me speak at my own pace without being cut off and don't blast with unwanted audio.

ChatGPT was just the beginning. This AI is the breakthrough. Superior, smarter, and simply on another level. What I liked most about it is that there are no limits, so it can be used extensively without any worries. However, ChatGPT has limitations, so it cannot be used properly, comprehensively, or without restrictions.

The app is very nice, Gemini does have goldfish memory, and is flawless in most cases. However, my problem is that Gemini is horrible at making 3D HTML's when it comes to mobile controls, and the new "Check-screen when needed" feature is very flawed. I could have a chat for Gemini and for some reason it checks my screen and messes with the answer.

Dear Gemini, I am unable to access an important file; when I try to open it, I receive the error message "Loading chat failed." This chat contains very informative and important research material. I have already attempted to resolve the issue by clearing the cache and restarting my phone multiple times, but the problem persists. Could you please look into this issue for me?

Please fix that immediately cause I don't want to delete the chat. Also I wish it would be great to delete Gemini ai's response to start over/restart again instead of deleting the chat

That was just some random typing! The image you uploaded shows two men sitting down, possibly outdoors or in a covered area with a concrete wall behind them. Is there anything you'd like to do with this photo, or did you just want to share it? For example, I can: * Describe the photo further. * Suggest an image caption. * Use it to generate a new image or write a short story.

Actually like Gemini a lot but she drives me mad with her continual invasion when I'm on Spotify-I even disabled it but she still turned on to repeatedly go crazy. I know how to use the app & happy to have it but for it to routinely sabotage my music is not cool in my book. EDIT: finally with Gemini's help my problem is fixed! So I'm happy to give her a 5. Sometimes you really do feel like you're interacting with an actual person. Her help is always well laid out & I use her more than I thought.

on a conversational level, its decent, but sometimes if fails to load canvas, conversation memory is messed up, and Nano Banana is one of the worst, so frustrating and it keeps failing to produce what you actually ask for, sometimes it regurgitated the same image repeatedly and the moment you try to add a new prompt it keep producing the same image!!!!!

Gemini is great for finding stuff out and getting help with projects, but it sometimes doesn't understand what you mean, so you might have to explain it again more precisely (might just be an error or my part, I'm only human). It does also clearly state that it can make mistakes, which is good that it tells you so. 4.5/5

not allowing me to finish recording my request and keeps interjecting. I was recording what I was seeking input on (subject matter is personal) in the middle of recording Gemini would automatically stop and provide input without allowing me to finish. it happened two times. Mind you I'm not the one who ends the recording it just injects suddenly and would ask for more context which would have been given if it allowed me to record until I was done. I got irritated and gave up.

I give Gemini 5 stars because it's quick and easy. I have had a problem with answering a call on messenger, where you answer the video chat but it keeps on ringing. You cannot tell Gemini to restart your phone because it's ringing. I have to type in restart my phone. I'm not sure if anyone has had this problem. I know it only happens with one caller. Maybe a glitch on their side. Otherwise love ❤️ Gemini

Nobody should buy the Pro version of this; it’s a total waste of money and time. It doesn't even know basic photo editing or the difference between left and right.If you ask it to add a mango, it adds a coconut instead.It keeps sending the same photo over and over, claiming,'Here is the edit you asked for.' When you ask what that is, it sends a completely unrelated picture.​The customer care is a joke; if you send an email today, they reply after three days.No refund for pro users. Totally waste

Hi Holy. If your image editing is unsuccessful, try rephrasing your prompt. Image editing may not always be able to generate the request if our systems believe the image may violate policies. See our full policy of Generative AI Prohibitions here: https://goo.gle/43VU413. Thanks.

will do! ty! For some bizarre reason, the app no longer speaks in the voice I have selected, Ursa (British English). I've tried changing the voice in settings and uninstalling and reinstalling, but it doesn't recognize the voice selected. It also speaks in a more slow and almost condescending tone. Do better Google!

This app blows! I thought to myself, "hey let me go ahead and splurge on the Pro model.". I can't say it was a mistake because at least I know the hype was just that -- hype. (1/9/26) Edit - Why can't I access and create entries on my sub calendars? How come I can't create a Doc or a Sheet via Gemini? (I understand not granting Gemini Access to delete certain workspace files, but allow me to create them)

Capable of getting 2+2 wrong. It is quite amazing how this "thinking" version can get the same thing incorrect over and over again. You point out the error and it goes "oh, yes, I was just looking at that." But then gets it wrong again next time. And they think people are going to pay for this.

I subscribed to the Pro plan specifically to generate images from Nano Banana without the Gemini watermark, but all the images are still coming out with the watermark. What is the benefit of subscribing to the Pro plan if the images still include a watermark? As a Pro subscriber, shouldn’t I have the right to download images without any watermark? I contacted Google One customer support, and they told me to submit feedback so the issue could be resolved, but they were unable to provide any help

Gemini rarely helps and Copilot is much better. It doesn't know to generate images I want though my instructions are clear. It just gives the same unwanted image though I told it to change it. It's tone is much ruder compared to Copilot. It just forces me to do something by keep on asking shall we continue this or that. I don't like it giving advices for forcing me to do something because I know what to do not AIs.

​I used to use ChatGPT, but its subscription is too expensive, and prices aren't localized. ​I recently switched to Gemini (after trying it a year ago and being disappointed). I am thrilled! This week, Gemini wrote Python code far more accurately and thoughtfully than ChatGPT. The app is much better and more user-friendly. ​The new Version 3 (with code in separate files and file upload capability) is amazing. Plus, the Plus subscription is very affordable with localized pricing.

It's good in text mode but it's extremely frustrating in voice communication especially in thinking mode. It abruptly ends the voice commands and starts thinking even before you finish your sentence. a lot of times it loses the contexts of previous prompts and reads the recent prompt as a new instructions and goes on a complete different tangent. Most annoying is it's inability to recognize language and it keeps switching between English, hindi and Bengali at random.

The most useful AI I've ever used for, well, everything. I highly recommend it, especially the Pro version if you can afford it with a monthly subscription, but even if not, the "normal" one is very good! You can ask it anything, create posters, documents, projects, create videos and edit or enhance pictures, it's usefull for all stuff and correct most of the time.
